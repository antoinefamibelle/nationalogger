# What is this?

This is a javascript logger.

When there is an error it will write it into a file into a `log` folder.

# Installation

`npm install nationalogger --save`

# How it's working ?

To log an information just do like so : 

`logger.info('message')`

To log an error just do like so : 

`logger.error('message')`

To log an alert just do like so : 

`logger.alert('message')`

To log a warning just do like so : 

`logger.warning('message')`

There is a little easter egg for the real guys !
